# Preparing for your apprenticeship

The information and exercises below will leave you in the perfect place to start the bootcamp phase of your apprenticeship, so we strongly recommend that you put some time aside for these preparatory activities.

# Git

From day one on the bootcamp and for the rest of your software development careers, you'll use a tool called Git.  Git is described [here](https://git-scm.com/) as a 'distributed version control system', but what does _that_ mean?  Let's break that down into two parts, `distrubuted` and `version control system`.  It's easier to consider these terms in reverse order...

## What is Git??

### Git is a version control system

Recall the last essay or report you worked on.  Did you create a few different versions with suffixes like `_draft`, `_with_comments` and `_final`?  Did you then create further versions along the lines of `_final_final` and `_final_final_approved`.  Did you get confused about which version was the good one?  When you're writing code, you're creating files of text, just like when you wrote that report, and the same situation _could_ occur, were it not for our friend, the version control system.

Version control systems allow you to work on one document (or directory of related documents), track changes and create 'checkpoints'.  These checkpoints are called 'commits' and the version control system allows you to revert back to any previous commit at any time.  It also does a LOT more, but you'll learn about when those features are useful to you.

### The versions of your documents are distributed

Another problem that Git solves relates to collaboration.  Perhaps when you were writing that last report, you wanted some input from a colleague and emailed them your version for them to add comments.  If you did that, or have ever done that, you'll know it can get messy, especially if more than two people are collaborating!

Perhaps you started using Google Docs, or another cloud based solution, years ago.  That's definitely one solution but Git is more powerful, as you'll see.  With Git you collaborate and share resources by pushing to and pulling from shared online storage spaces, called repositories.  Each collaborator then uses Git on their own machine.  So there are versions of your documents on many machines, which allows people to collaborate and makes it very hard for everything to be accidentally deleted! :)

## Getting started with Git

We recommend that you start here: http://gitimmersion.com/

You're ready to move on when you have a basic understanding of the following commands

> 1. git init
> 2. git clone
> 3. git add
> 4. git commit
> 5. git push
> 6. git pull
> 7. git log

Once you've ticked them all off, test your understanding by trying to explain them to someone else.

## Getting some further practice

We love our learners to track their learning in a learning log becuase reflecting on your learning process is a crucial part of improving it.

You could combine this with some git practice by creating a new repo on your own git account, then starting to track your learning in some documents there.  If you choose to do this, please share a link to the repo with your coach! :)
